# Monte Carlo Simulations of Data Classification
This repository holds code for running Monte Carlo simulations for comparing performance of the Jenk's Natural Breaks algorithm and the same algorithm run on the percentiles of the data.

## Files
JenksMonteCarlo.qmd - Contains code to run simulation study and analysis output data.\
randomSamp_Data.Rdata - Contains object with simluation results for data created by random sampling.\
skewedSamp_Data.Rdata - Contains object with simluation results for data created by random draw from an exponential function.
